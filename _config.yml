  I recently graduated from Metis, an ACCET accredited 12 week immersive data science bootcamp focused on project
  oriented learning.
  The core curriculum is centered around Python, statistics, supervised and unsupervised
  machine learning, exploratory data analysis, databases, and visualization techniques.
  While at Metis I completed five self-designed data science projects from conception to presentation;
  including data collection, data management, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and visualizations.

  I am currently looking for a position as a data analyst.
